# Ignore large files and common generated files

# Ignore all files larger than 8MB (requires git-lfs or manual check)
# Git itself can't filter by size in .gitignore, but you can list known large files or patterns

# Example: Ignore database dumps, logs, and binaries
*.log
*.sqlite
*.db
*.bak
*.tmp
*.pyc
__pycache__/
*.exe
*.dll
*.bin

# Ignore data/output folders if you have them
data/
output/
uploads/
*.zip
*.tar.gz

# Add specific large files if you know their names
# /path/to/largefile.ext
